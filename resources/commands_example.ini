; ================= DESKTOP AGENT COMMANDS =================
; Documentation: https://github.com/rig0/desktop-agent/wiki

; Configuration Options:
; [command_name]           - Unique identifier (alphanumeric, underscore, dash only)
; cmd = <command>          - The command to execute (required)
; platforms = <list>       - Comma-separated platforms: linux, win (optional)
; wait = <bool>            - Wait for completion and capture output (default: false)
; shell_features = <bool>  - Allow shell features like pipes, redirects (default: false)

; IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
;
; 1. Simple Commands (no shell features needed):
;    - Use for basic commands: firefox, code, notepad.exe, etc.
;    - These are executed securely without shell interpretation
;    - Leave shell_features unset or set to false (default)
;    - Example: cmd = firefox https://example.com
;
; 2. Commands with Shell Features (requires shell_features = true):
;    - Required for: pipes (|), redirects (>, <), command chains (&&, ;)
;    - Required for: environment variables ($VAR, %VAR%), command substitution
;    - SECURITY WARNING: Only use for trusted commands from safe sources
;    - Example: cmd = ps aux | grep python
;             shell_features = true
;
; 3. Wait Behavior:
;    - wait = false: Launch and detach (ideal for GUI applications)
;    - wait = true: Wait for completion and return output (ideal for scripts)
;
; 4. Platform Targeting:
;    - platforms = linux: Linux only
;    - platforms = win: Windows only
;    - platforms = linux, win: Both platforms
;    - Omit for all platforms
